.PRINTF(3)              Custom Library Functions Manual              PRINTF(3)

NAME
       _printf - Custom printf function for formatted output

SYNOPSIS
       #include "main.h"

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The _printf function produces output according to a format. It writes
       output to stdout, the standard output stream.

       The function is similar to the standard printf function but is a custom
       implementation with a limited set of specifiers.

       The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its
       initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or
       more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied
       unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of
       which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

       Supported specifiers:
       c - Prints a character.
       s - Prints a string.
       % - Prints a percent sign.
       d - Prints a signed decimal integer.
       i - Prints an integer in base 10.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the total number of characters written is returned. On
       failure, a negative number is returned.

EXAMPLES
       _printf("Character: %c\n", 'A');
       _printf("String: %s\n", "Hello, World");
       _printf("Percent: %%\n");
       _printf("Integer: %d\n", 100);
       _printf("Integer: %i\n", 100);
