_printf() Function Repository

Hello! Here we present the repository that contains all the necessary code for our custom function named `_printf()`. We are Dilan Soto and Javier Marrero, and we have developed a mini-version of the `printf()` function from the C language, found in `stdio.h`. Our `_printf()` function attempts to replicate the same process as the C `printf()` function. This project was carried out as part of a curriculum project of a Holberton School software development program. We hope you find it useful and interesting!

## Description

The `_printf()` function is like a student-made version of the famous C `printf()` function. In C, `printf()` is a tool used by programmers to display messages and data on the screen. For example, if you want to display "Hello world" on the screen, you would use `printf()`.

When students create their own version, which they call `_printf()`, they are practicing how to do something similar to what `printf()` does. It's like a school project where they try to imitate how `printf()` works but writing it themselves. This helps them learn:

1. **How to work with text**: They learn to change and organize text so that it appears a certain way on the screen.
2. **How to handle different types of data**: They understand how a function can receive and process various types of information.
3. **How to display information**: They learn how to make the information appear on the computer screen.
4. **How basic programming tools work**: They get an idea of how some common tools that programmers use work.

## Basic Usage of printf() in C

**Print Simple Text**
printf("Hello world");
This simply displays the text "Hello world".

**Print Variables**
int number = 5;
printf("The number is %d", number);
%d is a format specifier that indicates that an integer (int) will be printed here. The output will be "The number is 5".

**Print Various Types of Data**
int number = 5;
float decimal = 3.14;
printf("Integer number: %d, Decimal number: %f", number, decimal);
%f is used to print floating-point numbers (decimals).

**Common Format Specifiers**
%d or %i: For integers.
%f: For floating-point numbers (decimals).
%c: For a single character.
%s: For text strings (strings).
%%: To print the % symbol.
